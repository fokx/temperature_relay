# temperature Relay
This is a Keil C51 project using SHT3X temperature sensor and broadcast data via bluetooth to mobile device.

## Using codes from:
The following files
*sht3x.c*, *sht3x.h* are derived from
 vendor's sample code pdf 
 *Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Sample_Code_V2.pdf*,
 which provides reference implementation using
 this sensor with STM micro-controllers.
